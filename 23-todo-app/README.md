# todo-app

Todo app converted to nuxt, based off of tutorial from [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2). Good example of simple memory storage and DOM manipulation. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
