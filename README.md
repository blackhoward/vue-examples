# vue-workshop

Collection of Vue.js reference examples for teaching and learning Vue. These
examples can be run by opening the index.html file within your browser. These examples assume NO knowledge of front end by the reader. I myself had more experience as a backend engineer and found most front end examples required too much familiarity of HTML, Javascript and the front end stack. I journaled these examples to help myself and others if its helpful.
